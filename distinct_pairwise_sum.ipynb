    "It took my computer about 30 seconds to find a better solution.\n",

    "If we remove the `break` in the program above, it shows multiple results. Among which we can see even smaller result.\n",

    "\n",
    "Also, the current algorithm makes a set `sums` of 45 elements to verify each sequence. We should find a faster way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We notice that if a sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is a sequence with distinct pairwise sum, $\\{a_n + m\\}$ is also a sequence with distinct pairwise sum. Therefore, a unique distinct-pairwise-sum sequence can be represented by the difference between each element and its first element. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\{b_n\\} = \\{a_{n + 1} - a_1\\}, (1\\le n \\lt N)$. E.g. for $\\{a_n\\} = \\{1, 2, 3, 5\\}$, $\\{b_n\\} = \\{ 1, 2, 4 \\}$. So that another sequence starting with $3$: $\\{3, 4, 5, 7\\}$ is also a distinct-pairwise-sum sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we notice that $\\{b_n\\}$ should also have distinct pairwise sum. Otherwise if some $b_i + b_j = b_k + b_l, (1\\le i,j,k,l \\lt N)$, we would have $a_{i+1} + a_{j+1} = a_{k+1} + a_{l+1}, (1\\le i,j,k,l \\le N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we find a sequence $\\{b_n\\}$ of length $N - 1$, we can find many sequences $\\{a_n\\}$ of length $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we limit the largest number of $a_n \\le A$, we can find all distinct-pairwise-sum sequences of length $N$:\n",
    "- Starting from $N = 0$, the only distinct-pairwise-sum sequences of length $0$ with largest number $\\le A-N$ is $\\{\\}$.\n",
    "- If we found all distinct-pairwise-sum sequences of length $n$ with largest number $\\le A-N+n$, adding a number $a_1 \\ge 1$ would make a new distinct-pairwise-sum sequences of length $n + 1$ with largest number $\\le A-N+n+1$. There are about $A - N + n$ such new sequences (to garantee the largest number do not exceed).\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether the newly created sequence is distinct-pairwise-sum sequence, we already checked pairwise sums for $b_n$, so we just want to make sure pairs with new $a_1$ would not have duplicated sum:\n",
    "$$ a_1 + (b_i + a_1) \\notin \\{ (b_j + a_1) + (b_k + a_1) \\} $$\n",
    "which can be simplified to\n",
    "$$ b_i \\notin \\{ b_j + b_k \\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We should also notice that, if some $a_i + a_j = a_k + a_l$, we have $a_i - a_k = a_l - a_j$. Therefore, a distinct-pairwise-sum sequence of length $10$ must have $45$ distinct pairwise differences. So the smallest possible solution should be $46$. We can start with $A=46$ to find best solution."
